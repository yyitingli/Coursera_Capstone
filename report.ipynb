    "# Business problem\n",
    "### Background:\n",
    "As the COVID-19 pandemic attack the U.S. economy, it provides the best time to put house on the market due to low inventory and high demand. The low interest rate has attract investors heating up the housing market. However, it is difficult for unfamiliar investor to collect housing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Problem:\n",
    "In this senerio, a newly-formed real estate company, ABC inc., is searching for investors who are inexperienced with the real estate market in Bronx. The company's goal is to collect information to attract new investors and assist new investor to make a profitable purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Conmpany's plan is to use clustering method to classfy neighboods in Bronx and recommending suitable price and venues for their new investors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Selection\n",
    "The data of housing price in Bronx can be access through the open source from New York City Government (link: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page). It included all the rolling sales for past 12 months and it excluded the utility properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analyze and designate location between different vecnues, we will evaluate amenities and essential facilities in each region using the data provided by FourSquare API interface. Then we will use the venue data  to generate a report with visualization. The venue data  from the API includes a neighborhood's name, neighborhood's latitude, lneighborhood's ongtitude, venue, venue's name, venue's latitude, and venue's logititude.\n",
    "### Methodology:\n",
    "In this case, I'll use data cleaning methods from IBM data science class and KNN and KMeansclustering for modeling.\n",
    "The specific process is showned below"

    "### Result and Discussion:\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"Result1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the graph showing the result of clustering in Bronx which suggest there are variety of features for different kind of investors.\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"graph.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the graph shows the average price of each neighborhoods in Bronx which suggest there is variety of price from $100 per/SQFT to $1000 per/SQFT for investor which fit most investors around the world\n",
    "### Discusstion Section:\n",
    "The major business problem in this project is to process and visulize data in order to help the investors to make their investment decision on real estate market. To achieve this goal, we successfully process the real estate price and calculate their average price of each neiborhood and sort it ascendingly. The result of housing price is shown above that is efficient for investors to make their decision.\n",
    "Venue is another aspect that considered by house buyer. Our project sucessfully seperate the neighborhoods based on their venues to 3 patterns and I believe it will help home buyers for their decision making. For instance, people who consider the apartment near fastfood is more profitable would choose the apartment in cluster 2 which has fast food as its most common venue.\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "To make conclusion for this project,we find that there is a drop on the price of real estate market in the United States due to the COVID-19 situation which decrease customers' purchasing power. Therefore, we consider that at the same time there would be investors who holds differnet opinion that they think right now is a great timing for making investorment. So that our ABC company decides to analyze and visulize real estate data in Bronx to assist investors to make their decision. In the first place, we gathered data on Bronx real estates' price on 2019 which is the most recent price data from ((https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-rolling-sales-data.page) Moreover, to explore and target recommended locations across different venues according to the presence of amenities and essential facilities, we accessed data through FourSquare API interface and arranged them as a data frame for visualization. By merging data on Bronx's average price of each neighborhood and essential facilities surrounding such neighborhoods from FourSquare API interface, we were able to recommend profitable real estate investments.\n",
    "The project follows the workflow as \"Collecting data - understanding data - processing data - data modeling - Visualize data\". in the modeling section, we used the k-means clustering technique as it is fast and efficient in terms of computational cost. Finally, we grab the result that generated by k-mean clustering as the graph shows below which contains 3 different clusters with differnt feature and range in differnet price although there is N/A on some price value which is caused by missing data from data source. I believe the current real estate market in Bronx is highly diverse and it fits investors with differnet appitates."
